 - Complete mission tree
 - MiniMap in game : more detailed map, display peds, guns, radar focus,
    evacuation red circle
 - Mission objectives
 - Play sound in end mission animation
 - Remove debug info displayed in the console
 - Correct identification of object types during mission load, includes
vehicles, static objects
 - Adding properties to:
   vehicle: max people can hold; speed per type; damage can inflict/recieve per type;
radius of damage when destroyed
   people: add IPA levels and their modification through gameplay menu and influence
of these levels on different properties of people - speed, inteligence, accuracy,
viewing range(?), health recovery(?); mods properties should affect IPAs; damage
recieved modifier, if we don't want to recalculate all the time; persuade power
points; persuade points needed to persuade - this value will be added to agent
that succesfully persuaded; weapon range modifier(?); accuracy modifier/property(?);
 - static objects: damage recieve value; destructable or not
 - A.L. - this one is complex
 - pathfinding directional will be used for simulation of people walking
around the city
 - pathfinding directional, vehicles, for peds driving in the city
 - vehicle pathfinding needs to be tested on all maps and improved
(Greenland not working)
 - damage inflicted by vehicles/weapons, variate by type of damage and range
 - state of vehicles/people/objects should change correctly due to gameplay:
   switch of state due to damage
   change in behavior due to persuade
   firing should have delay, correct delay per ipa
   instant damage to objects
 - agent explode with mod chest lvl 2 or 3
 - animation for objects need to be fixed, to correctly represent every stage
of event/state:
   windows break when shot
   different objects burn
 - object positioning during drawing
 - map drawing still buggy
 - set weapons for enemy agents, because in gamedata weapons are not the same as
in original gameplay or are not present at all
 - write mission editor, create new mission files using editor, based on original
game mission files.
 - map editor
 - Implement dragging in SelectMenu to pass a weapon from an agent to another.
 - Create a debian package
 - add sound effects
 - mapmenu: player color update - if changed in configmenu; change of owners for
non-player owned territory, in original territory owners changed it was like
other syndicates where capturing territories
 - selectmenu make impossible to start gameplay with all agents non active+dead1
 - money increase after mission should not include completed mission's income
for time during this mission was completed

 Very low priority stuff, maybe for v0.9:
 - xmidi music data is not dealocated on exit - memory leak
 - "no_sound"/"no_music" option for config file
 - Add mission failure music
 - The built-in fonts have some characters that don't sit right vertically
(Ö and Ü in certain sizes)
 - Work on hyphenation rules in the text reflow code
 - Convert Italian and French translations to accented characters in UTF-8
 - Complete Italian translation
 - Reload button translation for non-English languages
 - Use game lost menu
