Installation Instructions
*************************

Original game data files
========================

	Due to licence restrictions, we don't distribute the original game data files.
You should have a copy of Syndicate or buy it. In order to run FreeSynd, copy
all files from the original Syndicate DATA directory to the FreeSynd Data
directory.
	You can also copy all files (original files and FreeSynd data files) to a unique
and distinct directory and tell Freesynd to read resources into it.	See the chapter
"Configuring Freesynd" to specify that directory.

====>Attention : Please, be sure to have files from the first version of Syndicate
as Freesynd does not support files from Syndicate Plus or Syndicate Wars.

Required Libraries
==================

	On Windows, all libraries are released with the game. You don't have to install
anything.
	
	In order to run FreeSynd under Linux, you first need to install:
 - libSDL-1.2
 - libSDL_mixer
 - libSDL_image
 - libpng

	On a debian based distribution you can do this as simply as:
apt-get install libsdl1.2debian
apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2

	For other distributions, consult the appropriate documentation.

Installation from released file
===============================

 * Windows Installation
 ----------------------

   Unzip the file in any directory you want. See chapter "Original game data files"
to add original Syndicate resources that are not bundled with Freesynd.

 * Linux Installation
 --------------------

   Unzip/untar file in your prefered directory and enter the newly 
created freesynd directory. Type the following commands:
	./configure
	make
	make install

	By default, FreeSynd will install its binaries in the 'bindir' and its data
in 'datarootdir/freesynd'. See chapter "Original game data files"
to add original Syndicate resources that are not bundled with Freesynd.

   Consult documentation on configure to know how to customize installation.

Building from source
====================

 * Windows
 ---------
	You can build the project using Visual C++ 2008 or Dev-cpp. See Readme files in the freesynd/projects directory.
	
 * Linux
 -------
   Enter the freesynd directory.
   Run the following commands to set the environment up :
	autoconf
	automake -ac

Then run those commands to build the game:
	./configure
	make

 * List of MACROs
 ----------------
	This is a list of all Preprocessor macros used when building the application:
  - _DEBUG : Activate debugging informations. Specify this macro at compile time
  - SYSTEM_SDL : Tells that the underlying graphic system is SDL. Specify this
  macro at compile time.
  
Configuring Freesynd
====================

	Freesynd reads the file freesynd.ini to get its running configuration.
You can edit the file with any text editore to customize your installation.

    On Linux, the application looks for the file in the $HOME directory but 
on Windows, it searches in the directory containing the freesynd.exe file. 
If the freesynd.ini is not found, then the application generates a new file 
with default parameters values.

Here is a description a each parameter :
 * fullscreen : (true/false) Setting true will run the game in fullscreen
 * play_intro : (true/false) True will play the game introduction.
 * data_dir : data files directory
 * language :  0:english, 1:french, 2:italian, 3:deutch
