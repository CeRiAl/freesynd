Gameplay:
---------
 - Complete mission tree : finishing a mission gives access to other missions
 - Mission objectives : implements all possible objectives
 - Correct identification of object types during mission load, includes
vehicles, static objects
 - Adding properties to:
   vehicle: max people can hold; speed per type; damage can inflict/recieve per type;
radius of damage when destroyed
   people: add IPA levels and their modification through gameplay menu and influence
of these levels on different properties of people - speed, inteligence, accuracy,
viewing range(?), health recovery(?); mods properties should affect IPAs; damage
recieved modifier, if we don't want to recalculate all the time; persuade power
points; persuade points needed to persuade - this value will be added to agent
that succesfully persuaded; weapon range modifier(?); accuracy modifier/property(?);
 - static objects: damage recieve value; destructable or not
 - in original territory owners changed, it was like other syndicates where
 capturing territories
 
 A.I:
----
 - A.L. - this one is complex
 - pathfinding directional will be used for simulation of people walking
around the city
 - pathfinding directional, vehicles, for peds driving in the city
 - vehicle pathfinding needs to be tested on all maps and improved
(Greenland not working)
 - damage inflicted by vehicles/weapons, variate by type of damage and range
 - state of vehicles/people/objects should change correctly due to gameplay:
   switch of state due to damage
   change in behavior due to persuade
   firing should have delay, correct delay per ipa
   instant damage to objects
 - agent explode with mod chest lvl 2 or 3
 
IHM:
----
 - animation for objects need to be fixed, to correctly represent every stage
of event/state:
   windows break when shot
   different objects burn
 - object positioning during drawing
 - map drawing still buggy
 - set weapons for enemy agents, because in gamedata weapons are not the same as
in original gameplay or are not present at all
 - add sound effects
 - mapmenu: player color update - if changed in configmenu; change of owners for
non-player owned territory
 - gameplaymenu after mission succesful/failed add timed auto switch to
debriefmenu after 5 sec or so

New features:
-------------
 - write mission editor, create new mission files using editor, based on original
game mission files.
 - map editor
 - Implement dragging in SelectMenu to pass a weapon from an agent to another.

Packaging:
----------
