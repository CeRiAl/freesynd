 - Complete mission tree
 - MiniMap in game : more detailed map, display peds, guns, radar focus,
    evacuation red circle
 - Mission objectives
 - Play sound in end mission animation
 - Remove debug info displayed in the console
 - Correct identification of object types during mission load, includes
vehicles, people, static objects, weapons, also setup sfx for weapons
 - Adding properties to:
   vehicle: max people can hold; speed per type; damage can inflict/recieve per type;
radius of damage when destroyed
   people: add IPA levels and their modification through gameplay menu and influence
of these levels on different properties of people - speed, inteligence, accuracy,
viewing range(?), health recovery(?); mods properties should affect IPAs; damage
recieved modifier, if we don't want to recalculate all the time; persuade power
points; persuade points needed to persuade - this value will be added to agent
that succesfully persuaded; weapon range modifier(?); accuracy modifier/property(?);
   static objects: damage recieve value; destructable or not
 - A.L. - this one is complex
 - pathfinding directional to be used for simulation of people walking around city
 - damage inflicted by vehicles/weapons, variate by type of damage and range
 - state of vehicles/people/objects should change correctly due to gameplay:
   switch of state due to damage
   when vehicle is destroyed, explosion should create damage to all in range
   change in behavior due to persuade
   "access card" make agent become police officer
   firing should have delay, correct delay per weapon(?)/ipa
   instant damage to objects
 - resolve shooting issues: targeting, range damage
 - animation for objects need to be fixed, to correctly represent every stage
of event/state:
   windows break when shot
   different objects burn
 - object positioning during drawing
 - map drawing still buggy
 - set weapons for enemy agents, because in gamedata weapons are not the same as
in original gameplay or are not present at all
 - write mission editor, create new mission files using editor, based on original
game mission files.
 - Implement dragging in SelectMenu to pass a weapon from an agent to another.
 - Manage Qwerty / azerty keyboard. Today only qwerty keyboard is used.
 - Add in select menu reload button for weapons
 - Configure menu, setting company/player name by pressing "Enter" key not only
 by pressing "OK" button
 - Create a debian package

 Very low priority stuff, maybe for v0.9:
 - Merge input feature from config/loadsave menus:
configure - has caret blinking, loadsave doesn't have it, but has caret
navigation with "left","right" keys and mouse caret positioning, insert/delete
from caret position.
 - Look at code that plays intro animation for possible errors.
 - "no_sound"/"no_music" option for config file, or disabled in debug mode
 - Re-rip music files, which currently have the "ping" sound embedded in them
 - Add mission failure music
 - The built-in fonts have some characters that don't sit right vertically (Ö and Ü in certain sizes)
 - Work on hyphenation rules in the text reflow code
