Gameplay:
---------
 - Complete mission tree : finishing a mission gives access to other missions
 - Mission objectives : implements all possible objectives
 - Correct identification of object types during mission load, includes
vehicles, static objects :
====
 vehicles - there are different types of them: the gray one - people/agents drive
them, police cars, ambulance, military heavy vehicle, firefighters, carbage collector,
train (it is multiple vehichles) should work as one - they need to have defined:
their type in main_type_, health should be checked to know how much health we
have per type, their animation should be defined and not loaded as we do now,
there are destroyed vehicles in game from start, as I use states, they should
have proper state set if destroyed, the attribute health is good but states are
easier to check in bulk with one varible single check instead of different variables
and multiple checks;
 statics - I have added hack for advertisement boards to draw them, it should be removed
and special attribute added to draw them at the end instead of that, animated
widows are not animated at all need separate class and animation switching,
trash bin/phone booth should be desctrutable with proper animation.
====

 - Adding properties to:
   vehicle: max people can hold; speed per type; damage can inflict/recieve per type;
radius of damage when destroyed
   people: add IPA levels and their modification through gameplay menu and influence
of these levels on different properties of people - speed, inteligence, accuracy,
viewing range(?), health recovery(?); mods properties should affect IPAs; damage
recieved modifier, if we don't want to recalculate all the time; persuade power
points; persuade points needed to persuade - this value will be added to agent
that succesfully persuaded; weapon range modifier(?); accuracy modifier/property(?);
 - static objects: damage recieve value; destructable or not
 
 A.I:
----
 - A.L. - this one is complex
 - pathfinding directional, vehicles, for peds driving in the city
 - vehicle pathfinding needs to be tested on all maps and improved
(Greenland not working)
 - damage inflicted by vehicles/weapons, variate by type of damage and range
 - state of vehicles/people/objects should change correctly due to gameplay:
   switch of state due to damage
   change in behavior due to persuade:
====
randomly walking when agent(persuador) stopped;
weapon search and pickup when persuador equips weapon, in view only and
closest by distance
====

 - firing delay per ipa (perception?), mod brain
 - instant damage to objects(handleDamage for all destructable)
 
IHM:
----
 - animation for objects need to be fixed, to correctly represent every stage
of event/state:
====
   different objects burn : phone booth, trash bin (, mail box?)
   we need to draw agents hair with color defined in cofmenu and of enemy
agents with color on map, also there seems to be grouping and enemies on
map have different hair color, should they be hostile?
====

 - map drawing still buggy:
====
object positioning during drawing;
tiles drawing order
====

 - add sound effects (needs "compare testing" against original syndicate)
 - mapmenu:
====
player color update - if changed in configmenu, change color for
non-player owned territory after player color change;
in original territory owners changed, it was like other syndicates where
capturing territories
====

 - Implement dragging in SelectMenu to pass a weapon from an agent to another.

New features:
-------------
 - write mission editor, create new mission files using editor, based on original
game mission files.
 - map editor

Packaging:
----------
 - Create a debian package

 Very low priority stuff, maybe for v0.9:
 ----------------------------------------
 - xmidi music data is not dealocated on exit - memory leak
 - "no_sound"/"no_music" option for config file
 - Add mission failure music
 - The built-in fonts have some characters that don't sit right vertically
(Ö and Ü in certain sizes)
 - Work on hyphenation rules in the text reflow code
 - Convert Italian and French translations to accented characters in UTF-8
 - Check all translations for correctness
 - Reload button translation for non-English languages
 - Use game lost menu
 - Remove debug info displayed in the console
