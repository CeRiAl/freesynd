Installation Instructions
*************************


Original Game Data Files
========================
  Due to licence restrictions, we don't distribute the original game data
files. You should have a copy of Syndicate or buy it. In order to run
FreeSynd, either copy all files from the original Syndicate "DATA" directory
into the FreeSynd "data" directory, or edit the FreeSynd configuration to
indicate where the original game's "DATA" directory is (see "Configuring FreeSynd" below). 
At first run Freesynd will test files located in your Syndicate "DATA" directory
to verify that required files are present and are correct.

====> Attention: Please, be sure to have files from the first version of
Syndicate as FreeSynd does not support files from Syndicate Plus or Syndicate
Wars.


Required Libraries
==================
  Freesynd needs the following libraries to build and run :
    - libSDL-1.2
    - libSDL_mixer
    - libSDL_image
    - libpng
  
  On Windows, all libraries are released with the game. You don't have to
install anything.
  
  Most popular Linux distributions already have packages for these libraries.
Use your distribution's package manager to install those libraries.

  For other distributions, consult the appropriate documentation.

Configuring FreeSynd
====================
  FreeSynd reads the file freesynd.ini to get its running configuration.
You can edit the file with any text editor to customize your installation.
When you run FreeSynd, a default ini file will be created for you if it does
not already exist.

  The location of freesynd.ini is different on each platform.
  * Windows: the folder containing freesynd.exe
  * Linux: $HOME/.freesynd/
  * Mac: $HOME/Library/Application Support/FreeSynd/

  (For Mac users who prefer the Linux/Unix way of doing things, a symlink will
be created at $HOME/.freesynd for your convenience.)

  The default location of freesynd.ini can be overridden on the command line.
Run freesynd --help to see usage information.

  Here is a description of each of the config file parameters:
    * test_data: (true/false) If true, the game will look for Original Syndicate
    Data and test it
    * fullscreen: (true/false) If true, the game will run in fullscreen mode.
    * play_intro: (true/false) If true, the introduction will be played.
    * freesynd_data_dir: Path to the FreeSynd "data" directory. This parameter
    should have a sensible default. Only set this if you really need to.
    * data_dir: Path to the original Syndicate "DATA" directory. By default,
    this will be the same as freesynd_data_dir.
    * language: 0:english, 1:fran√ßais, 2:italiano, 3:deutsch 

  After launch, play_intro will be turned off automatically.


Saved Games
===========
  Saved games are located in a different place on each platform.  

  * Windows: the folder containing freesynd.exe, + "save"
  * Linux: $HOME/.freesynd/save/
  * Mac: $HOME/Library/Application Support/FreeSynd/save/

  You may note that this location is based on the default ini file location.
The saved games location will not be affected by specifying a different path
for the ini file on the command line.
